Hi, I'm Cullen Hallinan. 

I am a web developer looking for an entry level position. 
I enjoy leveraging frameworks and packages for flexibility, efficiency, and clean design.


Included are some of my personal projects:


AoS Playmat Builder Web (Native JS)

  I started my web development with AoS Playmat Builder in HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. 
  I hosted it on Heroku and used a postgreSQL database.
  
AoS Playmat Builder Cross-platform (Flutter)

  Most recently I improved AoS Playmat Builder with Flutter, Firebase, and Android Studio.
  I improved the UI based on user testing. I rebuilt the entire application using 
  object-oriented Flutter and clean architecture principles. I used Python to convert and
  improve data from the original project.


Nartwhal

  I learned about JS frameworks and practised React by building Nartwhal, 
  an application for connecting people with art exhibits in their area.
  I worked with a design student who provided wireframes in order to get 
  experience working from a specific design. It pulls data from Cooper Hewitt 
  public API as an example museum exhibit data source.


FlaskSpellChecker

  For extra credit in a Python class I took, I hosted a spell check application 
  I made using Flask and AWS. It is currently under maintenance and planned improvement.
  
  
Recently added:
AoS Playmat Builder (Flutter)

  In a summer internship with easy-donate I learned Flutter and clean architecture. 
  To practice, I rebuilt AoS Playmat Builder from scratch. 
  I did so taking into account user testing from the original implementation. 
  I wrote a Python script to wrangle my custom hand-made data from the first application.
