Hi, I'm Cullen Hallinan. I am a web developer looking for an entry level position. I enjoy leveraging frameworks and packages for flexibility, efficiency, and clean design.

Included are some of my personal projects:

AoS Playmat Builder (Native JS)
  I started with AoS Playmat Builder in HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. I hosted it on Heroku and used a postgreSQL database.

Nartwhal
  I learned about JS frameworks and practised React by building Nartwhal, an application for connecting people with art exhibits in their area.
  I worked with a design student who provided wireframes in order to get experience working from a specific design. It pulls data from Cooper Hewitt public   API as an example museum exhibit data source.

FlaskSpellChecker
  For extra credit in a Python class I took, I hosted a spell check application I made using Flask and AWS. It is currently under maintenance and             planned improvement.
  
To be added:
AoS Playmat Builder (Flutter)
  In a summer internship with easy-donate I learned Flutter and clean architecture. To practice, I rebuilt AoS Playmat Builder from scratch. I did so         taking into account user testing from the original implementation. I wrote a Python script to wrangle my custom hand-made data from the first               application.
